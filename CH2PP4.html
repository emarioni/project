    <h1>Amortization Calculations</h1>

    <p>Amortization is when you pay off debt over a set amount of time
    in equal installments. Each month you will have a payment that
    will consist of the principal and the interest. The principal
    is the part that lowers the balance while the interest is the 
    part that goes to the bank as interest on the loan. With an
    amortization, the principal starts out small and gradually gets 
    bigger, vice versa, the interest starts big and gradually gets
    smaller. This is because at first, the balance is high, therefore
    more interest. As the balance gets lower, there is less interest
    and more principal. This website demonstrates how to calculate 
    the monthly interest, principal and total cost of the loan.

    <h4>Important Terms</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>Loan Amount: Total amount of money you are borrowing.</li>
      <li>Loan Term: The time it will take to pay off the loan.</li>
      <li>Interest Rate: The yearly rate also known as APR(Annual Percentage Rate).</li>
      <li>Monthly Payment: Minimum payment set by lender.</li>
      <li>Principal Amount: Amount going towards the loan.</li>
      <li>Interest Amount: Amount going towards interest.</li>
      <li>Balance: Amount left on loan after principal is paid.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps to calculate monthly interest and principal</h4>

    <ol>
      <li>First, we convert the percentage rate into a decimal and divide by 12 months.</li>
        <ul>
          <li> (4.50/100) / (12) = <mark>0.00375</mark></li>
        </ul>
      <li>Then, we multiply that result with the loan amount.</li>
        <ul>
          <li> 0.00375 * $10,000 = <mark>$37.50</mark></li>
        </ul>
      <li>We now know the monthly interest. To get the principal, we subtract the interest from it.</li>
        <ul>
          <li> $853.79 - $37.50 = <mark>$816.29</mark></li>
        </ul>
      <li>Now we can subtract the principal from the loan amount and get our new loan balance.</li>
        <ul>
          <li> $10,000 - $816.29 = <mark>$9,183.71</mark></li>
        </ul>
      <li>We repeat the process from step 2 with the new loan balance and continue to do this until<br>
          we have done the entire term. Then we can add up the interest from every month to get<br>
          the total interest paid. This will give us the cost of the loan.</li>
    </ol>
